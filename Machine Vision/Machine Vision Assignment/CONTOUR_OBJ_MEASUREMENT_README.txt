Readme file for contour_object_measurement.cpp file. 

The following are instructions on how to use the program. 
There are four sample images (draw_sample1/2/3/4) used for the program, each contains a pound coin taken as reference for the pixel to mm ratio.

User will have to select the Region of Interest(ROI) of the coin within each sample images. 
Afterwards, user will have to select the Region of Interest(ROI) of the object the wish to find the dimensions of.

There will then be a display of the dimensions in pixel and in mm. If the user wants to measure another object, the user will 
have to redo the coin ROI selection for obtaining the pixel to mm ratio, essentially restarting the program. 

This program was using opencv 470d extensions to run.
